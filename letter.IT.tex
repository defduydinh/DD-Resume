I am writing to express my interest in \position internship at your office. I notice this intern opportunity through your internship listing on \found.

\bigskip

I am currently a \schyear \ at University of Texas at Dallas, majoring in Computer Science with focuses in Cybersecurity and Information Technology courses.



\bigskip

Previously, I worked as a customer service associate at a local electronic store, working on improving customerâ€™s shopping experience while maintaining a safe work environment. During my experience there, I developed an essential communication skill to interact with customers and supervisors, while also demonstrated my ability to resolve a variety of issues and complaint with professional manner. I believe that my skill from working as customer service will elevate team-communication at your office, as it is important to provide concise and accurate report to increase security of information.

\bigskip

I would like an opportunity to meet with you to discuss my internship application for your office. Please contact me via email of \email or through mobile phone \phone.
